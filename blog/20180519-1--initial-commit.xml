<narrative date="Invalid Date"><heading level="1">initial commit</heading><paragraph>Hello, welcome to the first entry of (again) a new website about (again) myself. Whatever address you punched into your
browser, it probably has my username in it, so hey, what else is it gonna be about?</paragraph><paragraph>I could go off on a rant about what the purpose of this log is, but in truth, that'll probably have changed by the time
you read this. My interests lie in building cool stuff with technology (programming, usually) and I have a few other
old loves amongst creative crafts.</paragraph><paragraph>You can probably expect a presentation of:</paragraph><list><list-item><paragraph>My professional/business contact information.</paragraph></list-item><list-item><paragraph>Photos of my cat and other artistic expressions.</paragraph></list-item><list-item><paragraph>References to related material.</paragraph></list-item></list><code-phrase>&lt;!-- @TODO Mention resume/cv? --&gt;</code-phrase><paragraph>And hopefully none too much drunken ramblings that I'll later regret.</paragraph><paragraph>Signed,<code-phrase>&lt;br /&gt;</code-phrase>
Wybe.</paragraph><paragraph>ps. Renamed the file for this entry already, any system utilizing the fact that thsis is source control to the fullest
should now take that into account for ever. Sorry.</paragraph></narrative>
